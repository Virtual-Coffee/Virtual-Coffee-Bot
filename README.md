## Setting up

The bot runs on a schedule as managed by the GitHub Actions. They require the following [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) to be setup:

| Secret            | Source                                                      | Purpose                                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `SLACK_API_TOKEN` | [Bot User OAuth Access Token](https://api.slack.com/apps/)  | This allows us to post as a bot to slack  |

### Slack Bot Token Scopes

The following scopes need to be added to your Slack Bot to allow it to post messages.

| Scope               |
| ------------------- |
